1. Have a query that returns a list of target voters [x]

table for surveys

table for visits

table relating voters to visits

2. Create a visit (default to happened:false) for each voter



3. Algo gives each visit an order, and potentially a sub group

just do a for loop and also set the details on each visit for the first time (include the happened:false)

4. Input tool can update visits (bunch at once), displays rows based on visit number

a page that uses a url query

5. PDF printing tool prints walking lists that have needed information for volunteers
