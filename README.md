# paccenterclient
A geospacial tool that uses real time updates from web hooks


We need to build this out so that it is easy to add plugins.

We want a way to manage campaigns. Each campaign then gets its own admins who manage their volunteers. Volunteers get access to specific tools for their campaign.

Tools include

1. walking list generator
2. Walking list assigner
3. Walking list feedback gathering
4. Leaderboard stats (based off of walking list feedback).

There should also be a mobile app that allows visiting voters with realtime updates of all the volunteers efforts. The goal is to make door knocking a sport. 

There should also be a feature for delivering signs to voters who have requested one.
